The model is fitted to quarterly data for the post-war U.S. economy. Crucial features of the model are the assumption that more than one time period is required for the construction of new productive capital, and the non-time-separable utility function that admits greater intertemporal substitution of leisure. The fit is surprisingly good in light of the model's simplicity and the small number of free parameters.},

  abstract={We propose a numerical test of the non-parametric conditions for additive separability between consumption and real money balances, building on Varian (1983). If additive separability is rejected, then real balances enter into the theoretical IS curve. We test whether or not monetary assets and consumption are additively separable for the euro area using quarterly data from 1991 to 2005. Previous results using a parametric approach suggest that real balances can be excluded from the IS curve. We find that additive separability is violated over this sample period. After 1992, however, violations involve only a few observations and are in some instances related to measurement problems in the data. Overall, our results tend to support the claim that perfect non-separability between consumption and real balances is implausible, but that non-separabilities may not be very important empirically. At the same time, we reject additive separability throughout if we extend the sample period back to the 1980s, a period characterised by higher volatility in inflation and money growth.

abstract = {This paper studies the class of single-good Arrow–Debreu economies in which all agents have isoelastic utility functions and homogeneous beliefs, but have possibly different cautiousness parameters and endowments. For each economy in this class, the equilibrium stochastic discount factor is an exponential function of the inverse mapping of a completely monotone function, evaluated at the aggregate consumption. This fact allows for general properties of the class to be studied analytically in terms of known properties of completely monotone functions. For example, conditions are presented under which the agents’ cautiousness parameters and a distribution of initial wealth can be recovered from an equilibrium stochastic discount factor, even if nothing is known about the agents’ endowments. This is a multiagent inverse problem since information about economic primitives is extracted from equilibrium prices. Several example economies are used to illustrate the results.},

We show that the nature of the equilibrium path can be found out on the basis of essentially graphical techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of the model by analyzing the welfare implications of monetary and fiscal policy, and by showing that despite the price level being a predetermined variable, a policy of pegging the nominal interest rate will lead to the existence of a continuum of equilibria.}

These results weaken the links between the current generation of New Keynesian models and the real business cycle models from which they were originally derived.

This paper relaxes this tight and arbitrary restriction, by allowing for disturbances that have a rich contemporaneous and dynamic correlation structure.  Our first contribution is a new Bayesian econometric method that uses conjugate conditionals and Gibbs sampling to make the estimation of DSGE models with correlated disturbances feasible.  This provides a useful check for model misspecification in the search for models with structural disturbances.  Our second contribution is a re-examination of U.S. business cycles.  We find that allowing for correlated disturbances resolves some conflicts between estimates from DSGE models and those from vector autoregressions, and that treating government spending as exogenous in spite of its clear countercyclicality in the data is the main source of misspecification.  According to our estimates, government spending and technology disturbances play a larger role in the business cycle than previously ascribed, while changes in markups are less important.},

Using two empirical illustrations consisting of the Smets and Wouters model and a larger news shock model we show that the SMC algorithm is better suited for multimodal and irregular posterior distributions than the widely used random walk Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. We find that a more diffuse prior for the Smets and Wouters model improves its marginal data density and that a slight modification of the prior for the news shock model leads to drastic changes in the posterior inference about the importance of news shocks for fluctuations in hours worked. Unlike standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques; the SMC algorithm is well suited for parallel computing.},
